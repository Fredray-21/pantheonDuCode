## efreiPoker

This is an implementation of winning probability calculations for a poker hand (2 cards) in four possible scenarios: preflop, flop, turn, and river. The program estimates winning probabilities based on a simulation of **100,000 rounds**.

Additionally, users can choose the number of players at the table, ranging from **1 to 5**, to see how this affects the winning probabilities.

### Probability Calculation Scenarios

- **Preflop**: Evaluation of winning chances before community cards are dealt.
- **Flop**: Evaluation of winning chances after the first 3 community cards are dealt.
- **Turn**: Evaluation of winning chances after the 4th community card is dealt.
- **River**: Final evaluation of winning chances after the 5th community card is dealt.
